I have been programming for about 22 years as a hobby. This is the third basic programming
language I have used. I created this program in Visual Basic 6, which I have been using for 4
years. I am not sure if this code is compatible with Visual Basic 5 or Visual Basic Net (VB7).
I do not wish to have anyone use this program or any part of it in their or someone else's
program. I have not had any problems or errors with it, but you are using it at your own risk.
After being compiled, this program is not compatible with a Mac, only a PC. If the program
stopped due to an error on your PC, the cursor will still be off. In this case, simply press Control
and Break at the same time and this should restore the cursor, making it visible again. I have
added a lot of comment lines to the program - it explains a lot more in general than this notepad
file does. I programmed (created) Pinwheel about 1 and 1/2 years ago, so without further effort,
I do not have a comment line for everything in the program. It is not easy to remember exactly
what every procedure I created does or is for. I have created over 200 programs in Visual
Basic 6. I have created 250 - 300 programs in other basic languages.

I hope you enjoy viewing my program and I hope you can learn something from it, just as I have
learned from other peoples' programs. I also compose my own music, playing bass, 6-string, 12-string, flute, piano and singing. I record my own songs, performing all the instrument and
vocal tracks myself. I love expressing myself in a creative way, whether it is with music or
programming. My desire to do so will never end.

Have a great day!
